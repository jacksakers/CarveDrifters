Design Document: Carve Drifters (Dual-Foot Snowboard Physics)

1. Concept Overview

"Carve Drifters" is a physics-based traversal game where the player controls a snowboarder's feet individually to steer, accelerate, and brake down an infinite slope. The core challenge is coordinating the left and right legs to maintain momentum while avoiding obstacles.

2. Core Mechanics

The "Dual-Binding" Control Scheme

Unlike traditional games where you steer the character directly, here you steer the feet, and the board follows.

Left Foot: Controlled by WASD.

Right Foot: Controlled by Arrow Keys.

The Board: A rigid body that snaps to the position of the two feet.

Physics & Movement

Stance & Angle: The angle of the snowboard is calculated dynamically based on the relative position of the left foot vs. the right foot.

The Fall Line (Gravity): The "Slope" pulls everything down (Positive Y).

Acceleration:

Parallel to Slope (Vertical): Minimal friction, maximum acceleration (Gravity takes over).

Perpendicular to Slope (Horizontal): Maximum friction (Edges digging in), rapid deceleration.

Diagonal: A mix of forward momentum and steering.

Velocity Vector: The board moves in the direction it is pointing (carving). Drifting (moving sideways) is minimized unless at low speeds, to simulate edges cutting the snow.

3. Implementation Steps

Step 1: Input System

Track the state of 8 distinct keys (W, A, S, D, Up, Down, Left, Right).

Allow independent movement of "Left Foot" and "Right Foot" relative to the player's Center of Mass (COM).

Step 2: The "Rig" (Player Model)

Center of Mass (COM): The pivot point.

Feet Constraints: Feet can move, but they are tethered to the COM within a maximum radius (legs have a max length).

Board Calculation: Draw a line/rectangle connecting the two feet center-points.

Step 3: Slope Physics

Calculate BoardAngle.

Calculate AlignmentFactor: How close is BoardAngle to the global DownVector?

If 100% aligned: Add speed.

If 0% aligned (perpendicular): Subtract speed (Friction).

Update World Position based on Velocity.

Step 4: World Generation

Camera: Centers on the player.

Obstacles (Trees): Spawn infinitely as the player descends (y-coordinate increases).

Score: Based on distance traveled.

Step 5: Visuals

Snow: White background with subtle trails.

Player: Simple geometric representation (Blue Left Foot, Red Right Foot, Wooden Board).

Trees: Triangles.

4. Controls Summary

W/S: Move Left Foot Up/Down (relative to body).

A/D: Move Left Foot Left/Right.

Up/Down: Move Right Foot Up/Down.

Left/Right: Move Right Foot Left/Right.

5. Winning/Losing

Lose: Hit a tree or come to a complete stop for too long (stuck).

Win: Infinite runner (High Score).
